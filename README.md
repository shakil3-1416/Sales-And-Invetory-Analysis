The goals of inventory analysis
Before getting into any metrics, it’s important to understand what the specific goals are when it comes to doing inventory analysis.

The general objective is to improve overall inventory efficiency. But breaking this down even further would involve aiming to:

Identify improvement areas. Metrics should be compared to past results and industry benchmarks to identify where problem areas lie.
Reduce stock-outs. Stock-outs should be seen as huge red flags for retailers, and inventory analysis will help minimize them as much as possible.
Improve cash flow. Analysing inventory now will prevent sinking too much cash into stock at any one time going forward.
Waste less inventory. Analysis and improvements will help minimize inventory shrinkage, such as stock that gets lost, stolen or damaged beyond repair.
 
This all has the bottom line effect of making the business more profitable, while also improving the experience for customers.
Inventory analysis is the regular auditing of inventory in the pursuit of continuous improvements to how it is managed. This can be done through a variety of commonly used inventory KPIs and ratios.

Regular monitoring of these metrics is a key part of inventory management, and so we explore each method in-depth within this article.

ABC analysis
ABC analysis is a commonly used inventory analysis method that helps to identify your most valuable inventory.

It’s based on the Pareto principle – AKA the 80/20 rule. Applied to retail, this would suggest that around 80% of sales would typically come from 20% of a company’s total inventory.

ABC analysis uses this theory to sort inventory into three buckets:

A inventory	Inventory with the highest value – typically your 20% that brings in 80% of sales/profits. These are usually items with the best profit margins and/or most sales revenue.
B inventory	Inventory that sells regularly, but doesn’t have quite as much value as A – often due to having slimmer margins or higher carrying costs.
C inventory	The remainder of inventory that doesn’t sell as much as A or B, generates the least revenue and is generally least valuable.
This kind of analysis helps identify the key players in a retail business’s inventory.

 
A inventory, for example should rarely (if ever) stock-out and be given the highest priority and focus. While C inventory may not warrant quite so much attention.

Inventory analysis metrics
ABC analysis isn’t the only way to draw conclusions from your inventory. There are several key metrics that can be used to measure performance and uncover ways to optimize operations.

1) Average inventory
Average inventory measures the average volume of inventory kept on-hand throughout a given period.

It comes from adding together the beginning inventory (BI) value at the start of a period and the ending inventory (EI) value at the end of the period. Then simply dividing by two to find the average:
